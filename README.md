## Portfolio (web developer)

Link To Go: [BLOW.][link]

------------

### Description

Paraphrasing the words of one revolutionary (Tiler Derden): "The HTML will gain structure - there will be page layout. Add CSS - there will be styled page. And animation and adaptability - there will be site page. Having a lot of pages - you can [BLOW][link] up everything in the World Wide Web."

##### The recipe is simple::
- Some Html5;
- A bit more CSS3;
- A bit of adaptability with FlexBox;
- And the site layout from these guys: [TPVERSTAK][TPVERSTAK] (Thank you!).
